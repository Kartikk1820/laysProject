      <p class="company-description mt-3">
        In 1867, Henri Nestlé, a pharmacist, started a small company in Vevey,
        Switzerland, developing a breakthrough infant food product to help
        nourish babies who couldn’t be breastfed. Just a few years later, his
        business grew significantly, and the Nestlé name became synonymous with
        nutrition and health.
      </p>
      <p class="company-description">
        In 1905, Nestlé merged with the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company to
        form what we now know as Nestlé S.A., expanding its product offerings
        and cementing its role as a global leader in nutrition, health, and
        wellness.
      </p>
      <p class="company-description">
        Nestlé products entered Canada in 1918, bringing a wide array of
        nutritious food items that quickly gained popularity for their quality.
        By the mid-20th century, Nestlé became a household name not only in
        Canada but across the world. Today, Nestlé offers a vast range of
        products, including baby foods, bottled water, dairy products, and
        confectionery.
      </p>
      <p class="company-description">
        Nestlé has grown its portfolio to include numerous renowned brands, each
        offering consumers the same dedication to quality and innovation that
        Henri Nestlé stood for over 150 years ago.
